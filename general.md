# For Short-Term Visitors

* If you are coming for a temporary stay from a country which participates in the Visa Waiver program (e.g. France, Italy, Germany, etc…) and you are planning to receive any reimbursements: you must have a WB stamp in your passport. You get this by entering the US on the visa waiver program business visa. Please note that this is different from the visa waiver program tourist visa, which gives you a WT stamp in the passport. We will not be able to reimburse your expenses if you have a WT stamp and not a WB stamp. Ask Paul for a letter of invitation that will facilitate you getting a WB stamp. 
For your reference, here is the [form](http://www.matse.psu.edu/files/financial_uploads/visitform.pdf) you will have to fill out when you are here. 
* Please keep your boarding passes, you may need those for reimbursement. For administrative reasons, you will have to wait till after your departure to receive the reimbursement.
* For wifi access, you can use the “attwifi” network. You can also obtain access to the “psu” network, which is a little bit more reliable. To do this, send Paul an email asking him to email helpdesk@cse.psu.edu and request a STAA (Short-Term Access Account) on your behalf.
* If you are visiting for more than just a few days, you should also get a wired Ethernet connection at your desk. Please email admin@bx.psu.edu to do this.
